# equity-risk-model

Risk attribution and optimisation using a multi-factor equity risk model.

Includes functionality to:
* Calculate risk, risk contributions and risk concentration measures
* Optimise a portfolio to be factor *neutral* or *tolerant*

The directory `notebooks` contains some jupyter notebooks which provide a 
starting point to exploring and developing equity risk models. It is by no 
means comprehensive, so the usual caveats apply.
